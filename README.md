# 3DScanner-with-RealSense-and-Open3d

### Note that this is a Simplified Attempt on 3D recreating

 This is a Notebook that collects Color images and depth images from Intel Realsense Camera (In my test case Realsense-435) and creates a mesh using the Open3d python library.
 The notebook mainly consists of two blocks, One for data collecting and One for processing. All the necessary Instructions to use were given.
 Code was based on the Reconstruction System of Open3D examples, and necessary changes and additions were created to reach the goal.
